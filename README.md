# Digital_Mirror
My digital mirror focuses on the break up of the image. It provides a lot of different individual pixels to be shown.
The highlight is for the image to be distorted and look like a broken mirror of collective colors. I really wanted it
to be identified as abstract art.  The polygons are continuously drawing and picking up the color of a single pixels. 

I was cahllenged by this project because the code to drawing the polygons are randomized and make for a diffrent picture. The code itself was a whole nother challenge that I had to try and figure out. My orignial idea diffres from the concept but I really enjoy the movement and changing of the overal piece.
